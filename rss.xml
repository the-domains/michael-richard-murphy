            <title><![CDATA[Broken Windows]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Broken Windows</h1><p>I first heard about broken windows in Paul Graham’s book Hackers and Painters. Broken windows was originally a criminology theory along the lines that obvious neglect and disorder breeds more neglect and disorder. We’ve all seen abandoned buildings full of broken windows. They didn’t start out that way. Most people would be reluctant to throw the stone that breaks the first window. But once one or two are broken, and not replaced, that apparent apathy makes it easier to continue the trend. It slowly erodes that “barrier to entry”. People who wouldn’t ordinarily do something like that possibly consider it because, after all, it’s obvious that nobody cares. Before you know it, all the windows are broken. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6c9d0ee8b199ba78dfe5b2daf88f442a2213acab.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Fake It 'Til You Make It]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Fake It 'Til You Make It</h1><p>We’ve all heard that catchphrase and frankly, I think it gets a bad rap. Maybe it’s because when the word ‘fake’ is applied to things it usually means a cheap or low quality knockoff. And fake people are phony or superficial. So fake as a descriptor isn’t exactly a ringing endorsement.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/33b63a84eda0fb1d1d9789abec6db9cccf77b91b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Good Spaces and Third Rooms]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Good Spaces and Third Rooms</h1><p>I was introduced to the idea of good spaces and third rooms a few weeks ago during a talk at TEDxBuffalo and I’ve been fascinated by the concept ever since. I think it stuck with me because it finally provided a name for a concept I had been thinking about but couldn’t really identify.</p></article>]]></description>
